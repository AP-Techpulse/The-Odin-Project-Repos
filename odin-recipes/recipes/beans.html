        <li>Rinse the beans thoroughly and soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight to reduce cooking time. Drain before cooking.</li>

        <li>Add the ground crayfish (if using) and chopped Scotch bonnet peppers. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or broth, ensuring the beans are fully covered. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beans are tender. Stir occasionally and add more water if necessary.</li>
        <li>Once the beans are cooked, season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, stir in chopped spinach or ugu leaves and cook for an additional 5 minutes until wilted.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with fried plantains, garri, or your favorite side dish.</li>
